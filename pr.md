1. What did you like about this website?
I love the theme of your website! I also love the title of your business! I think the use of flexboxes makes your website look very clean
and organized. The photos also make the website very fun!
2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
One difference that I see between our websites is that my header sticks to the top of the page and yours doesn't. I think your header fits 
better for your site thought so it is a good design.
    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think my website has a user experience simply because there isn't a lot on your website. Also, your prices aren't defined
    for your services so it isn't as realistic.
    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I think both of our code bases are equally maintainable. We both did a good job of keeping our CSS and images in their own folders.
    We also both put a lot of stuff in our shared CSS file so that make our code easy to maintain!
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
Yes, your code is very well organized. Also, like I said earlier, you put everything you needed to in your shared CSS file which makes your
code very easy to structure.
    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements
    N/A
4.  Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
Nope, the site looks great!
    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
    Yes, the variables names were good, and you were able to make your code very readable!
    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Yes, the CSS looks good, and the shared CSS file keeps duplication at a low.
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
The only thing I might change about your site is keeping more consistent fonts. There is like 5+ fonts on your site and it can just be 
a lot to look at. I love your site though and think it is a great business design!!
